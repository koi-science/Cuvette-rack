You can build one yourself from 3mm acrillyc or plywood, just laser cut the shapes from the .dxf files in the Export directory.
You will need:

- 1x of Bottom_3mm.dxf
- 2x of Top_3mm_2x.dxf
- 2x of Side_3mm_2x.dxf

And use appropriate glue to stick them together.

If you want to build more than a dozen, consider 3D printing the assembly jig. You will need.

- 1x Assembly-jig-base.stl
- 2x M3 screw 30-40mm long.
- 2x a soft spring, 4-5mm in diameter, 15-20mm long.
- 4x M3 washers, ~5mm OD.
